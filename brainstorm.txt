Engine will look something like:

Player(level, hp, mp, attack)
Monster(level, hp, mp, attack)



Player always decides action; monster only retaliates

player.attack(monster) ?
engine.resolve_attack(player, monster) ?

"Effects" get shuttled back and forth
eg. -5 HP, +1 curse, -all MP

Player sends effect,
  which gets applied to Monster,
  Monster returns effect,
  which gets applied to Player




Monster can be attacked
Takes attack information (effect)
  Returns different effect
